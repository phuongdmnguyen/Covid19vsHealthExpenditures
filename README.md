# Covid-19 cases vs Health Expenditures by OECD member countries

In this project, I downloaded health statistics from OECD stats (https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?ThemeTreeId=9) and scraped web COVID 19 data from Worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/?utm_campaign=homeAdvegas1?). Using these data I plan examine if there is a relationship between these two variables using a correlation test.
